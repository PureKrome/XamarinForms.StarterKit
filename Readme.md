# Xamarin Forms - Starter Kit

This is a common template for Xamarin Form applications. Why keep re-inventing the same first pages, views and authentication?  
Start your new app, based off this template.  
Includes:
- Login screen (if not logged in) for Facebook/Google auth.
- Dashboard landing page once authenticated.
